Description: This package performs Mendelian randomization for multiple exposures and outcomes with Bayesian structure learning 
    and causal effects estimation. The directionality of the causal effects between the exposures and the outcomes is assumed known, 
    i.e., the exposures can only be potential causes of the outcomes and no reverse causation is allowed.
